var greating = 'Hello'


in Browser:
	console.log( greating ) 								: => Hellow
	console.log( window.greating ) 					: => Hellow


in Terminal (Node):

	console.log( greating ) 								: => Hellow
	console.log( global.greating ) 					: => undefined


Now we can see Node `global` not working 100% same as browser `window` dose.
